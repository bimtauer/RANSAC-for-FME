This is a Python RANSAC implementation built from scratch to work together with the geodata processing software FME.

My approach so far has been tailored towards using this RANSAC directly within FME to automate object detection tasks in point clouds, for example inventories of urban infrastructure such as light- and signposts. 

However the RANSAC class and its corresponding geometry models are to be designed as a lone standing tools that can be flexibly used.
